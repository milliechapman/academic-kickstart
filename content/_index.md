  I am a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in the department of [Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM)](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/), a visiting researcher at the [International Insitute of Applied systems Analysis](https://iiasa.ac.at/), and a core team member at [Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/). My research is at the intersection of decision theory, ecology, and data justice, asking how we can create more effective and equitable strategies to meet global environmental targets in an age of algorithms.
