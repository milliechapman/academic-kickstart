   My research is at the intersection of decision theory, ecology, and data justice, critically exploring how computational tools can help us develop effective and equitable strategies to meet global biodiversity and climate targets. I'm currently a tenure track assistant professor at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in the [Department of Environmental Systems Science](https://usys.ethz.ch/en/), an expert on the [IPBES Spatial Planning and Connectivity Assessment](https://www.ipbes.net/spatial-planning-assessment), and a lead author on the [North America Biodiversity and Climate Change Assessment](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/climate-adaptation-science-centers/science/biodiversity-and-climate-change-assessment#overview).  More info on my research and group can be found on the [Environmental Policy Lab](https://epl.ethz.ch/) website! Please check out our open [PhD or Postdoc opportunities](https://epl.ethz.ch/the-group/open-positions.html) if you're interested in joining and/or reach out if you just want to jam on ideas!
   
   Prior to ETH, I was a visiting faculty researcher at [Google Research](https://research.google/), a research fellow at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) and a core team member at [Climate Change AI (CCAI)](https://www.climatechange.ai/). I received my PhD from the University of California Berkeley in the department of [Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM)](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/).
