  I am currently a postdoc at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) and a core team member at [Climate Change AI (CCAI)](https://www.climatechange.ai/). My research is at the intersection of decision theory, macroecology, and data justice, asking how we can devise (and realize) more effective and equitable strategies to meet global biodiversity conservation and climate mitigation targets in an age of algorithms. I received my PhD from the University of California Berkeley in the department of [Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM)](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/).
