   My research is at the intersection of decision theory, environmental policy, and data justice, critically exploring where, when and how computational tools can help us develop effective and equitable strategies to meet global environmental targets.  I'll be starting as a tenure track assistant professor of Environmental Policy at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in the [Department of Environmental Systems Science](https://usys.ethz.ch/en/) in July 2025! In the meantime, I'm a visiting faculty researcher at [Google Research](https://research.google/), a research fellow at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) and a core team member at [Climate Change AI (CCAI)](https://www.climatechange.ai/). I received my PhD from the University of California Berkeley in the department of [Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM)](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/). 
   
   More info on my research group coming soon, but please reach out if you are interested in PhD or Postdoc opportunities (or if you just want to jam on ideas)!
