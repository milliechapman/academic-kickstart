  I am currently a visiting faculty researcher at [Google Research](https://research.google/), a postdoc at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) and a core team member at [Climate Change AI (CCAI)](https://www.climatechange.ai/). My research is at the intersection of decision theory, ecology, and data justice, asking how we can develop more effective and equitable strategies to meet global biodiversity targets in an age of AI. I received my PhD from the University of California Berkeley in the department of [Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM)](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/). 
  
  I'll be starting as a Tenure Track Assistant Professor at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) in the [Department of Environmental Systems Science](https://usys.ethz.ch/en/) in July 2025! More info coming soon, but please reach out if you are interested in discussing PhD or Postdoc opportunities!
