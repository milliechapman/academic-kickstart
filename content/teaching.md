### ESPM 157: Data Science for Global Change Ecology
(Graduate Student Instructor)  [ESPM 157](https://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/), is an upper division undergraduate course, covering 
reproducible data science methods in the context of global change ecology. Beyond assisting with the course, I worked on developing and teaching a new learning module on exploring open source geospatial methods through an environmental justice lens (you can check out the [module](https://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/modules) and corresponding [code template]() if interested!)


### Fung Fellowship Conservation and Technology Mentor
The [Fung Fellowship](https://fungfellows.berkeley.edu/) is an immersive undergraduate learning experience that inspires students to become innovators for social good. I'm a graduate student mentor for multiple undergraduate fellows working on applied problems with partner organizations at the intersection of conservation and technology.


### Undergraduate Research Mentor
I'm always excited to work with students on developing projects at the intersection of data science and environmental policy. I've mentored a number of honors thesis and undergrad research ([URAP](https://urap.berkeley.edu/)) students on projects ranging from fisheries management to climate policy. Check out our latest paper, led by undergraduate Sally Dowd, [here](https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2578)!

### Culturally Relevant Education
I'm part of the [Environmental Data Science Inclusion Network](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/edsin/), and have participated in  multiple [Culturally Relevant Education in Environmental Data Science](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/edsin/creeds) workshops. I'm continually working to create more inclusive academic spaces for students.

### Bay Area Scientists in Schools
Outside of the university, I'm an instructor for [Bay Area Scientists in Schools](https://crscience.org/educators/basis/) program. I teach interactive modules on population dynamics and biodiversity metrics with elementary and middle school students across the East Bay (Oakland, Berkeley, El Cerrito, Richmond)!
