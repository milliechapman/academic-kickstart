Core to my teaching philosophy is creating experiential, inclusive, and creative learning environments. As a science educator with a primary focus on teaching computational and data science methods through a social-environmental lens, I actively work to break down barriers to quantitative learning with culturally responsive pedagogy. As an interdisciplinary environmental scholar, I am passionate about creating curricula that build up, and on, students' domain interests and life experiences. 

### Climate Change AI Summer School

I am one of the organizers of the climate change AI summer school, which is designed to educate and prepare participants with a background in artificial intelligence (AI) and/or a background in a climate change-related field to tackle major climate problems using AI.The summer school consists of two independent components: an open-to-all virtual program, which in summer 2023 has over 5,000 participants, and a fully funded "by application"" week long in-person program for 40 students from around the world!

### ESPM 157: Data Science for Global Change Ecology
(Graduate Student Instructor)  [ESPM 157](https://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/), is an upper division undergraduate course, covering 
reproducible data science methods in the context of global change ecology. Beyond assisting with the course, I worked on developing and teaching a new learning module on exploring open source geospatial methods through an environmental justice lens (you can check out the [module](https://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/modules) and corresponding [code template]() if interested!). This active learning module has since been used to teach hundreds of students spatial analysis skills over the past three years and was the basis for a recent NASA TOPS grant.


### Fung Fellowship Conservation and Technology Mentor
The [Fung Fellowship](https://fungfellows.berkeley.edu/) is an immersive undergraduate learning experience that inspires students to become innovators for social good. I'm a graduate student mentor for multiple undergraduate fellows working on applied problems with partner organizations at the intersection of conservation and technology.


### Undergraduate Research Mentor
I'm always excited to work with students on developing projects at the intersection of data science and environmental policy. I've mentored a number of honors thesis and undergrad research ([URAP](https://urap.berkeley.edu/)) students on projects ranging from fisheries management to climate policy. Check out our latest paper, led by undergraduate Sally Dowd, [here](https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2578)!

### Culturally Relevant Education
I'm part of the [Environmental Data Science Inclusion Network](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/edsin/), and have participated in  multiple [Culturally Relevant Education in Environmental Data Science](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/edsin/creeds) workshops. I'm continually working to create more inclusive academic spaces for students.

### Bay Area Scientists in Schools
Outside of the university, I'm an instructor for [Bay Area Scientists in Schools](https://crscience.org/educators/basis/) program. I teach interactive modules on population dynamics and biodiversity metrics with elementary and middle school students across the East Bay (Oakland, Berkeley, El Cerrito, Richmond)!
