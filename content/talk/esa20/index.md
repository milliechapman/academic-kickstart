abstract: Both ecosystems and social systems have been observed to abruptly change
  states as the result of crossing some critical threshold. Theories of ecological
  multistability have long described this phenomenon and explored how ecological management
  impacts stability landscapes, with underlying tipping dynamics assumed to stem from
  ecological processes. Similarly, examples from social science suggest that tipping
  points may result from complex features of human systems; from the collapse of societies
  , to social networks dynamics such as the spread of innovations. Despite widespread
  interest in the causes and location of tipping points in integrated socio-ecological
  systems, it has generally been assumed that the underlying dynamical complexity
  was ascribed either to social process or natural phenomena. Using a Markov Decision
  Process to represent forward looking decision making in a stochastic ecological
  environment, we explore how rates of ecological processes (ecosystem service build
  up) interact with decision making processes to result in long term multistable trajectories
  of adoption of diversified farming practices.Temporal feedbacks between a farmer's
  investment choice, based on their perceived utility over a given time horizon, and
  probabilistic changes in the ecological services derived from the environment, can
  result in alternate stable states. Because benefits of ecosystem services take time
  to accrue, farmers in environments with degraded land are unlikely to invest in
  agroecology, while farmers who benefit from ecosystem services are more likely to
  bolster those services further. This path dependency leads to a bifurcation into
  either a more-simplified or more-diversified farming approach, which echoes empirical
  findings. We show that these alternate stable states need not be an inherent feature
  of either ecological or decision dynamics but can emerge as a very general pattern
  by dynamically coupling a simple ecosystem model with a rational decision process
  over time. We suggest that better understanding such tipping points has important
  implications for policy design across a range of domains, including land tenure
  and agricultural subsidies.
