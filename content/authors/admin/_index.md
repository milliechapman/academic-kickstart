I am a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in [Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM)](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/), and a fellow at the UC Berkeley [Center for Society Technology and Policy](https://ctsp.berkeley.edu/) and with the [Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Working Group](https://afog.berkeley.edu/). My dissertation work explores the dynamics of coupled human and natural systems under uncertainty and across scales, leveraging methods from decision theory, ecology, and data science. My research spans systems, from farms to forests to fisheries, seeking to examine how we think about protection, production, and environmental justice in a rapidly changing world. 

My current work is largely thanks to both of my academic advisors and wonderfully supportive labmates in the [Boettiger Group](https://www.carlboettiger.info/) and [Brashares Group](https://nature.berkeley.edu/BrasharesGroup/).
