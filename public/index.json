The chapters of my dissertation span systems from farms to forests to fisheries, seeking to examine both protection and production in a rapidly changing world. And while we pave a path for the next decade of conservation science in the wake of more advanced decision-making algorithms, my dissertation explores why we must simultaneously, and urgently, ask the question: Whose values are shaping decisions about our planet’s health?\nMy current work is largely thanks to the mentorship from my PhD advisors, Carl Boettiger and Justin Brashares, and my wonderfully supportive labmates in the Boettiger Group and Brashares Group. Much of my research is informed by the many mentors, collaborators, and coworkers I had during my time as a research assistant at the Woodwell Climate Research Center and motivated by my teenage years working on (sub)urban farms and food justice issues in my local community with The Food Project.\n","date":1595808000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1595808000,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/melissa-millie-chapman/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/melissa-millie-chapman/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in the department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management (ESPM), and a fellow at the UC Berkeley Center for Society Technology and Policy and Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Working Group.","tags":null,"title":"Melissa (Millie) Chapman","type":"authors"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596632400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596632400,"objectID":"565ed3f1e94c4162ffc68bb3c3172c53","permalink":"/talk/esa20/","publishdate":"2020-08-05T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/esa20/","section":"talk","summary":"Both ecosystems and social systems have been observed to abruptly change states as the result of crossing some critical threshold. Theories of ecological multistability have long described this phenomenon and explored how ecological management impacts stability landscapes, with underlying tipping dynamics assumed to stem from ecological processes. Similarly, examples from social science suggest that tipping points may result from complex features of human systems; from the collapse of societies , to social networks dynamics such as the spread of innovations. Despite widespread interest in the causes and location of tipping points in integrated socio-ecological systems, it has generally been assumed that the underlying dynamical complexity was ascribed either to social process or natural phenomena. Using a Markov Decision Process to represent forward looking decision making in a stochastic ecological environment, we explore how rates of ecological processes (ecosystem service build up) interact with decision making processes to result in long term multistable trajectories of adoption of diversified farming practices.Temporal feedbacks between a farmer's investment choice, based on their perceived utility over a given time horizon, and probabilistic changes in the ecological services derived from the environment, can result in alternate stable states. Because benefits of ecosystem services take time to accrue, farmers in environments with degraded land are unlikely to invest in agroecology, while farmers who benefit from ecosystem services are more likely to bolster those services further. This path dependency leads to a bifurcation into either a more-simplified or more-diversified farming approach, which echoes empirical findings. We show that these alternate stable states need not be an inherent feature of either ecological or decision dynamics but can emerge as a very general pattern by dynamically coupling a simple ecosystem model with a rational decision process over time. We suggest that better understanding such tipping points has important implications for policy design across a range of domains, including land tenure and agricultural subsidies.","tags":[],"title":"Tipping points in diversified farming systems","type":"talk"},{"authors":["William Oesteich","Melissa (Millie) Chapman","Larry Crowder"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Static protected areas have long been a keystone of conservation but are generally insufficient for such species and habitats. Spatially and temporally dynamic management (DM) has arisen as a potential solution to this challenge. We present what we believe to be the first comparative anal-ysis of DM across marine and terrestrial systems, focusing on the scales of DM approaches. Our results show that marine DM has largely been focused on relatively finer temporal scales, whereas terrestrial DM has focused on relatively finer spatial scales, often following the scale of available and relevant datasets. We explore not only the constraints imposed by data availability but also other drivers of DM trends and scales, highlighting areas in which exchange of approaches pioneered in each domain may be  beneficial.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A comparative analysis of dynamic management in marine and terrestrial systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Melissa (Millie) Chapman","Wayne Walker","Susan Cook-Patton","Mary Farina","Bronson Griscom","Peter Ellis","Alessandro Baccini"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

We find that global croplands currently store 3.07 Pg of carbon (C) in aboveground woody biomass (i.e., trees) and pasture lands account for an additional 3.86 Pg C across a combined 3.76 billion ha. We then estimate the climate mitigation potential of multiple scenarios of integration and avoided loss of trees in crop and pasture lands based on region‐specific biomass distributions. We evaluate our findings in the context of nationally determined contributions and find that the majority of potential carbon storage from integration and avoided loss of trees in crop and pasture lands is in countries that do not identify agroforestry as a climate mitigation technique.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Large climate mitigation potential from adding trees to agricultural lands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bronson W Griscom","Jonah Busch","Susan C Cook-Patton","Peter W Ellis","Jason Funk","Sara M Leavitt","Guy Lomax","Will R Turner","Melissa Chapman","Jens Engelmann","Noel P Gurwick","Emily Landis","Deborah Lawrence","Yadvinder Malhi","Lisa Schindler Murray","Diego Navarrete","Stephanie Roe","Sabrina Scull","Pete Smith","Charlotte Streck","Wayne S Walker","Thomas Worthington"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

As countries enhance their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement, confusion persists about the potential contribution of better land stewardship to meeting the Agreement's goal to hold global warming below 2°C. We assess cost-effective tropical country-level potential of natural climate solutions (NCS)—protection, improved management and restoration of ecosystems—to deliver climate mitigation linked with sustainable development goals (SDGs). We identify groups of countries with distinctive NCS portfolios, and we explore factors (governance, financial capacity) influencing the feasibility of unlocking national NCS potential. Cost-effective tropical NCS offers globally significant climate mitigation in the coming decades (6.56 Pg CO2e yr−1 at less than 100 US$ per Mg CO2e). In half of the tropical countries, cost-effective NCS could mitigate over half of national emissions. In more than a quarter of tropical countries, cost-effective NCS potential is greater than national emissions. We identify countries where, with international financing and political will, NCS can cost-effectively deliver the majority of enhanced NDCs while transforming national economies and contributing to SDGs.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"National mitigation potential from natural climate solutions in the tropics","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544533200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544533200,"objectID":"bf946f2e47dbc6ec2e32f1bc0814c2d1","permalink":"/talk/agu18/","publishdate":"2018-12-11T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/agu18/","section":"talk","summary":"While crop and pasture lands account for approximately 39% of global land cover, available estimates of the climate mitigation potential of agroforestry systems are based on coarse estimates of both cropland extent and aboveground carbon density. This paper seeks to improve upon previous estimates of carbon storage within trees in crop lands by utilizing global 30-meter resolution cropland extent and biomass density data. The results indicate that ca. 1.98 billion ha of cropland account for 9.42 Pg of global aboveground carbon storage. Additionally, we extend the analysis beyond croplands to include the climate mitigation potential of trees in pasture and grazing lands, which account for an another 4.35 Pg C across ca. 2.02 billion ha. The as yet unrealized climate mitigation potential of crop and pasture land is calculated under five scenarios of agroforestry expansion utilizing current biomass distribution in geographically specific agroforestry systems. This research provides an important first step in understanding system-specific signatures of carbon density in agroforestry systems, leading to the comprehensive assessment of landscape scale climate mitigation potential.

The present study contributes to this by assessing both proximate and underlying causes of deforestation in two REDD+ pilots of the Équateur province. The study found that agricultural expansion through shifting cultivation is the main proximate cause of deforestation. This activity is accelerated by logging that simplifies clearing of land. Logging also contributes to the total biomass loss from the forest. Shifting cultivation is driven by the poverty conditions of the study area. Poverty is also linked to the political and institutional structures of forest governance. These structures are controlled by political elites who influence local decisions to clear forests. While actions to curb deforestation might be challenging, this study suggests that addressing the underlying causes through effective land use planning and developing robust accountable institutions while providing alternative economic opportunities to the local population are necessary.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Institutional analysis of causes of deforestation in REDD+ pilot sites in the Equateur province: Implication for REDD+ in the Democratic Republic of Congo","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"b339208092f107238a5689dbb77eade3","permalink":"/project/abnj/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/abnj/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["ABNJ","Optimization","Environmental Justice"],"title":"Centering environmental justice in the prioritization of high seas protection","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"8de36a31738828bb9081dad948b73faf","permalink":"/project/mesopelagics/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mesopelagics/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["AI","Conservation","Power"],"title":"Ecological impacts of mesopelagic fisheries","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"e74ff9c7447389901956dc32388bfdde","permalink":"/project/alg_cons/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/alg_cons/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["AI","Conservation","Power"],"title":"Environmental conservation in the age of algorithms","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"7bf5e981b1fb45202dbbca590e9818ce","permalink":"/project/ses/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ses/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["AI","Conservation","Power"],"title":"Tipping points in diversified farming systems","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"34dd22b32767166348f8a8c4fe8fc4dd","permalink":"/project/sesync-grad/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sesync-grad/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["Agroforestry","Social-ecological systems"],"title":"Using Decision Making Models to Design Effective Policy for Natural Climate Solutions","type":"project"},{"authors":["Brendan D Galvin","Zhiru Li, Estelle Villemaine","Catherine B Poole","Melissa Chapman","Michael P Pollastri","Paul G Wyatt","Clotilde KS Carlow"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The process is catalyzed by myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), an enzyme which has been validated as a drug target in human cancers, and for infectious diseases caused by fungi, viruses and protozoan parasites. We purified Caenorhabditis elegans and Brugia malayi NMTs as active recombinant proteins and carried out kinetic analyses with their essential fatty acid donor, myristoyl-CoA and peptide substrates. Biochemical and structural analyses both revealed that the nematode enzymes are canonical NMTs, sharing a high degree of conservation with protozoan NMT enzymes. Inhibitory compounds that target NMT in protozoan species inhibited the nematode NMTs with IC50 values of 2.5–10 nM, and were active against B. malayi microfilariae and adult worms at 12.5 µM and 50 µM respectively, and C. elegans (25 µM) in culture. RNA interference and gene deletion in C. elegans further showed that NMT is essential for nematode viability. The effects observed are likely due to disruption of the function of several downstream target proteins. Potential substrates of NMT in B. malayi are predicted using bioinformatic analysis. Our genetic and chemical studies highlight the importance of myristoylation in the synthesis of functional proteins in nematodes and have shown for the first time that NMT is required for viability in parasitic nematodes. These results suggest that targeting NMT could be a valid approach for the development of chemotherapeutic agents against nematode diseases including filariasis.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A target repurposing approach identifies N-myristoyltransferase as a new candidate drug target in filarial nematodes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Courtney Cunningham","William C Chen","Andrew Shorten","Michael McClurkin","Tenzin Choezom","Christian P Schmidt","Victoria Chu","Anne Bozik","Cameron Best","Melissa (Millie) Chapman","Moran Furman","Kamil Detyniecki","Joseph T Giacino","Hal Blumenfeld"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
