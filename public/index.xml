      <description>ol { display: flex; flex-direction: column-reverse; }  Translating science into policy is an important part of my work. Currently, I am a science consultant and technical writer for the California 30x30 Initiative and am broadly interested in conservation and climate policy at global, national, and sub-national scales.
A selected list of technical reports, white papers, and policy documents that I have contributed to writing can be found below:</description>

      <title>Teaching and Mentoring</title>

      <description>Core to my teaching philosophy is creating experiential, inclusive, and creative learning environments. As a science educator with a primary focus on teaching computational and data science methods through a social-environmental lens, I actively work to break down barriers to quantitative learning with culturally responsive pedagogy. I am passionate about creating curricula that build up, and on, students&amp;rsquo; domain interests and life experiences.
Climate Change AI Summer School     I was one of the organizers of, and mentors for, the climate change AI summer school, which is designed to educate and prepare participants with a background in artificial intelligence (AI) and/or a background in a climate change-related field to tackle major climate problems using AI.</description>
